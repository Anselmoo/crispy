Crispy is written using `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and relies on a number of additional open-source scientific libraries which are part of the Python ecosystem. It runs on all major operating systems and is a free and open-source software. The development can be followed on the `Github <https://github.com/mretegan/crispy>`_ page.

The project is developed at the `European Synchrotron Radiation Facility <http://esrf.eu>`_ by `Marius Retegan <http://marius.retegan.org>`_.
